    "If you've been reading the documentation as you should be, you may have noticed the `target_metric` argument of all children of `BaseOptPro` is usually a tuple. The `BayesianOptPro` class we used above is just one of the descendants of `BaseOptPro`, but we were passing `target_metric` values of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the documentation notes, all `target_metric` values are cast to tuples, in which the first value identifies which dataset's evaluations should be used. The default behavior is to target the \"oof\", or out-of-fold, predictions' results. So, when we were using `target_metric=\"<string>\"` in our examples above, our optimizer interpreted it as `target_metric=(\"oof\", \"<string>\")`.\n",

    "This allows us to tell our optimizers to optimize metrics calculated using predictions on other datasets, like a holdout dataset.\n",
    "For example, had we initialized `Environment` with a `holdout_dataset`, our experiments would actually calculate 8 metrics instead of the 4 they currently do: 4 for our OOF predictions, and 4 for our holdout predictions. Then, if we wanted to optimize using holdout evaluations, we can use `target_metric=(\"holdout\", <metric_name>)`."
